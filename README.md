# Paradine-test

This repo was set up to host the test sent to me by Paradine, The initial work on this test was created in google colabs on Sunday evening 12/6/22
it has then been adapted into a github repo mostly because I wanted to play around with github workflows and its automated testing. This is mostly
to see if I can make Tox redundant as the testing within workflows seems to be a little faster.

At the time of writing this the test had been effectively completed in about 40/50 mins I decided to use the remaining time to further my understanding of new CI/CD functionality in github as well as some new file management techniques.

The toy data has been loaded into the app in dictionaries to be quickly parsed out into workable pandas dataframes, various pytests have been designed to test the functionality of the data parsing techniques in 3 different virtual environments running different versions of python.

3 Checks are at the bottom of the test_main.py file labeled in comments.
