# Data-OOP-TDD

I decided to use the remaining time to further my understanding of new CI/CD functionality in github as well as some new file management techniques.

The toy data has been loaded into the app in dictionaries to be quickly parsed out into workable pandas dataframes, various pytests have been designed to test the functionality of the data parsing techniques in 3 different virtual environments running different versions of python.

3 Checks are at the bottom of the test_main.py file labeled in comments.
